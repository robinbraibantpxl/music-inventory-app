                <h2>Tool - <span>Aenima</span></h2>
                <p>
                    An original blend of Alternative Metal, thanks to Maynard James Keenan’s vocal melodies, and
                    Progressive Metal, owing to the creative polyrhythms in each and every song. “Ænima” is an
                    unpredictable album, surprising listeners with atmospheric, heavy, progressive, and even
                    experimental passages
                </p>

                <h2>The Strokes - <span>The New Abnormal</span></h2>
                <p>
                    Just how raw the band's emotions are on The New Abnormal is surprising and riveting. "Ode to the
                    Mets" is all the more poignant because it sounds like Casablancas is telling off someone who's
                    already long gone. When he interrupts the torchy groove and long-simmering recriminations of "Not
                    the Same Anymore" to wail "I was afraid/I fucked up/I couldn't change/It's too late," it's potent
                    proof that the Strokes can still surprise. Full of passion, commitment, and creativity, The New
                    Abnormal marks the first time in a while that the Strokes have made truly exciting music.
